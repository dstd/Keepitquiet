Your phone or TV shouldn't scare you with a loud sounds. Originally the app was designed for TV, so that when I turn it on in the morning it wouldn't scream into my ears, and I could choose appropriate volume level.

It helps one to control the sound volume with these options:
- reduces when device is turned off (if there's no playback)
- reduces when playback ends
- highlights the muted volume when playback is started, by showing the volume control (so that you can quickly adjust the volume)
- combines the volume control for ringer and notifications (for ex-iPhoners)
